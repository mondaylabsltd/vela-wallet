# Specification Quality Checklist: 086 — Issue sweep

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs). Exception: FR-004, FR-017 and FR-019 name the project's own house rules (rules decided once in the shared core, fixes on every shell, one PR per issue), which are delivery constraints rather than design.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (the 16 listed issues, plus the same defect on sibling shells)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (see the Content Quality exception)

## Notes

- All items pass on the first iteration. Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
